  - modified default gnome3 appearance
  - modified window-list extension for gnome3, not ugly anymore

### window-list modified extension for gnome3 ###
Gnome 3 has classic mode, that try to looks like Gnome 2. Unfortunately, it uses bright colors, but hey, it's just bunch of extensions for regular Gnome. By default, window-list is ugly, therefore I changed it a little bit to make sleek panel.

Don't turn on windows grupping, don't use it in Gnome Classic.
